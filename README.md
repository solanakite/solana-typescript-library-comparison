# Solana TypeScript Library Comparison

This repository compares different Solana TypeScript libraries by implementing the same simple task: creating a wallet on devnet, airdropping 1 SOL to it, and sending a memo transaction.

The example was originally taken from the https://www.gillsdk.com/api/gill and adapted for comparison across different libraries.

Code complexity is measured by counting programming tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, punctuation) while excluding comments and whitespace. Token counting is performed using the TypeScript Compiler API.

## Libraries Compared

- [Solana Kit (modern, with plugins)](https://solanakit.com)
- [Solana Kite](https://solanakite.org)
- [Gill](https://www.gillsdk.com)
- [Framework Kit](https://github.com/solana-foundation/framework-kit)
- [Metaplex Umi](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/umi)
- [web3.js v1](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [web3.js v1 with @solana-developers/helpers](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers)
- [Helius SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk)

## Token Counting

```bash
npx tsx count-tokens.ts
```

## Results

Run `npx tsx count-tokens.ts` to see the results. As of 2026 01 21, they are:

```
